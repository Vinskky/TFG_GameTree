## Prototype

This repository serves as aditional material for my university thesis.

In this prototype, we will test if we can manage to make a game using a different approach compared with decision-making video games.

This prototype will help me to gather some conclusions after the investigation done inside the thesis "From Game Trees to a Narrative Game Prototype"

## Goals

Learn more about the chosen approach toward the implementation of a decision-making system considering its base in Game Trees from Game Theory.

## Narrative Introduction

We control Ava, a young woman that lives with his parents. After being sick for a week, she receives a message from his colleagues to go to a party and celebrate with them a Birthday. As a player we will need to interact with her parents and keep making decisions to arrive to one of the multiple endings this little story has.
